wordcount   2016/06/03 v1.7


The package provides a relatively easy way of estimating the number of
words in a LaTeX document that does not require dvitty or other DVI
converters. It does however require something like Unix grep -c that
can search a file for a particular string and report the number of
matching lines. An accompanying shell script wordcount.sh contains
more information in its comments.

Following Michael's death, his family have requested that his TeX
related files are made publicly available under the LPPL license.


The wordcount package is available under the
LaTeX Project Public License version 1
or (at your option) any later version.
