The regression coefficient represents the additional metaphorical violence uses that occur with each message the candidate tweets. $r^2$ represents the fraction of variance that is represented through a linear relationship with candidate tweets. The 2016 candidates's Twitter use had a greater impact on metaphorical violence usage than the 2012 candidates's. In both years, Twitter use had a strong effect on metaphorical violence use where the tweeting candidate was cast as the subject of metaphorical violence, or where the other candidate was the object of metaphorical violence.\relax }}{30}{table.caption.9}%
